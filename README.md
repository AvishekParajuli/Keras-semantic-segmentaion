# Keras-LinkNet

Keras-TensorFlow implementation of [*LinkNet: Exploiting Encoder Representations for Efficient Semantic Segmentation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03718), ported from the lua-torch implementation [LinkNet](https://github.com/e-lab/LinkNet) created by the authors.

# This is work in progress
